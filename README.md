Data Analysis using CRISP-DM
College education is expensive. College costs have increased over the last few decades and
this trend is expected to continue. Typical college cost of attendance consists of several
components and in this project we study a dataset consisting of 1368 students’ cost of
attendance data and all the various components. We would like to understand the trends
of individual components of the cost and also the overall trend of cost of attendance. We
would like to understand why college costs can or can’t college costs be kept lower. We
hope to analyze the data and understand the trends and hopefully predict the future costs.
This analysis might help future students with valuable insights into how much one should
save for education, planning for education funding or what components of the costs can be
managed effectively to keep the overall cost of going to college for higher education. While
these are our proposed aims, we are open to let the data mould our research and conclude
our findings.
As part of this project we apply our design and understanding of various data extraction,
cleaning, analysis and modeling techniques learnt during the length of our course and
evaluate the dataset provided. The dataset consists of 1368 observations with 65 variables
describing each observation. The data consists of observations both from undergraduate
and graduate levels of education.
